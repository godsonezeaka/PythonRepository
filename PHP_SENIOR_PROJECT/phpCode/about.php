            GlamLooks was founded by our CEO, Godson A. Ezeaka. Ten years ago, 
			Godson started our company by researching into products that are best suited for the people. 
			We have since grown as a company and we continue to carry this vision. Last year we won an 
			award for best online health and beauty website. 
			GlamLooks is invested in getting you the best quality products and this is our motto.
