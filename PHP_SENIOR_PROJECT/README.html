            <p> This senior project was based on creating an ecommerce website that has a front end functionality
                as well as a backend that interacts with a database using mySQL. The backend logic is written
                in PHP. Front end logic involves HTML, CSS and some javascript. Database used is managed by phpMyAdmin
                Ecommerce website involves a cosmetic site that sells various kinds of products.
